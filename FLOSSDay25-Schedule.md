## Workshop details

- 14:30 - 15:45: Workshops Session #1
  - **Git Basics** (E-501), by Alexandru Cirlan, Beginner Level.
    - A VCS (Version Control System), such as "git", is a tool to allows programmers to save their work and be able to revert to it easily, as well as make modification, and collaborate on the same software project without interference and errors. Git is a modern VCS, commonly used in open-source projects due to its simplicity and ease of use. The workshop aims at teaching you the basics of git, so you can use it in your future projects.
    - _No skills required._
  - **Build Your Web Portfolio** (Library), by Giuliana Bouzon, Beginner Level, _Personal Laptop RECOMMENDED_.
    - In this workshop you'll learn about different FLOSS tools to build a website, and some strategies to package and deploy your website on the Internet.
    - _Desired skills (but not required)_:
      - Basic git experience.
      - Basic coding knowledge.
      - Some web development knowledge (basic html, css, js, json).
