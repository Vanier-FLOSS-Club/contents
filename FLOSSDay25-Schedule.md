    - A VCS (Version Control System), such as "git", is a tool to allows programmers to save their work and be able to revert to it easily, as well as make modification, and collaborate on the same software project without interference and errors.

    - _No skills required._

    - Using git wrongly will inevitably happen at some point, or you might encounter a situation where you need to revert a bug in production code, this is the workshop for you to learn how to do that! We will cover project management in git and Github, handling errors and mistakes, as well as linking Github to external tools for improved developement pipelines. We will also go in depth around traversing and using git's more complex tooling to allow for more effective source control.
